title: Chatroom rules
---

 * **Android is not Java:** Due to the fact that Android uses Java as its main development language, combined with the fact that the [Android room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android) is invite-only, it is not uncommon for us to get visitors with Android questions. Android is considered off-topic for this room. Sorry.
 * **Neither is JavaScript:** Please field your JavaScript questions to the [JavaScript room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/javascript).
 * **We are not on the clock:** We are a group of professional and hobbyist programmers who like to spend our down time conversing with other like-minded individuals. We are not paid to field questions or provide advice. If you would like to ask a question, please remember that this room is not a help desk or consultation service.
 * **Be Professional:** We are responsible for the computer systems that society relies on more and more with every passing day. Please act as though that responsibility weighs heavily on you.
 * **Stay on-topic (in good faith):** This room's main topic of conversation is the Java programming language.
 * **This is still SO:** Even though this is not part of Stackoverflow's main site, the rules still apply here.
 * **Have fun:** This is the obligatory final rule whose purpose is to lighten the mood and welcome you into the group. Consider yourself welcomed. xD
