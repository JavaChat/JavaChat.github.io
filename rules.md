title: Chatroom rules
---

 * **Android is not Java:** Due to the fact that Android uses Java as its main development language, combined with the fact that the [Android room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/15/android) is invite-only, it is not uncommon for us to get visitors with Android questions. Android is considered off-topic for this room. Sorry.
 * **Neither is JavaScript:** Please field your JavaScript questions to the [JavaScript room](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/javascript).
 * **Do not paste code blocks into the chat:** If you need to show somebody your code, please post your code to a code sharing site such as [paste.ofcode.org](https://paste.ofcode.org/). Then, post the URL to your code snippet in the chat room.
 * **We are not on the clock:** We are a group of professional, student, and hobbyist programmers who like to spend our down time conversing with other like-minded individuals. We are not paid to field questions, provide advice, or tutor. If you would like to ask a question, please remember that this room is not a help desk or consultation service.
 * **Be Professional:** We are responsible for the computer systems that society relies on more and more with every passing day. Please act as though that responsibility weighs heavily on you.
 * **Stay on-topic (in good faith):** This room's main topic of conversation is the Java programming language.
     * **But general topics are on-topic:** Discussion about development tools such as version control and IDEs are allowed. General programming concepts that aren't directly related to Java are also allowed.
 * **No playing with bots:** No playing with the bots: You are free to use them to post the occasional cat picture or play a sneaky troll on a friend. But please don't use them to the point where the chat is purely revolving around you and others fooling around with them. You are welcome to play with them in the Sandbox where many of the bots in the Java room are also present. Ignoring this rule will first lead to your messages being removed from the chat, then to a verbal warning, and eventually to a kick.
 * **This is still SO:** Even though this is not part of Stackoverflow's main site, the rules still apply here.
 * **Have fun:** This is the obligatory final rule whose purpose is to lighten the mood and welcome you into the group. Consider yourself welcomed. xD
